# Hi, I'm Rohan Anthony

**Software Engineer (ex-IBM) • MSc Data Science @ University of Bristol**  
**Backend • Systems • Full-Stack • Applied ML**

I’m a software engineer with experience building **distributed systems, secure C++ agents, backend services**, and **cloud-deployed machine learning pipelines**.

I enjoy working across the stack — from **low-level systems and networking** to **Python APIs, DevOps**, and **applied ML** — with a strong focus on correctness, clarity, and maintainability.
