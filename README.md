# Hi, I'm Rohan Anthony

**Software Engineer (ex-IBM) • MSc Data Science @ University of Bristol • Backend, Systems & ML**

I'm a software engineer with experience building **distributed systems, secure C++ agents, backend services**, and **cloud-deployed ML pipelines**.  
I enjoy working across the stack—from **low-level systems** to **Python APIs**, **DevOps**, and **data science models**.

Currently, I'm building personal projects that combine **systems engineering, AI, and modern full-stack development**.
